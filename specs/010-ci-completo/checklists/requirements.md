# Specification Quality Checklist: CI completo + branch protection

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-04
**Feature**: `specs/010-ci-completo/spec.md`

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain — **resolvidos 2026-09-04: FR-006 = 90 (medido 95%), FR-009 = frouxos+sem-bypass**
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Bloqueio: FR-006 + FR-009. Após resolução, atualizar spec + Clarifications e marcar este item — então `/speckit-clarify` ou `/speckit-plan`.
